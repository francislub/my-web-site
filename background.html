   <h1><s>WHAT I WILL NEVER FORGET</s></h1>
    <p>In my background, I will never forget what made me to hate playing and witching football. When i was in P.4 i used to love playing football and football was my best and lovely activity which i would do and my classmate used to call me RONALD. One day we had a play at school and the tearm which we were going to play with was from another neighboring school. In the blink of an eye the game started and as we were approaching the end of the first half, my leg was beaten by someone and it was even about to brake off and to treat it was really expensive yet my Father had no Money. This resulted into selling part of our polot. "I WILL NEVER PLAY FOOTBALL AGAIN" </p>
